# DegenAI
Privacy Tools for the Digital Resistance


**Welcome to the underground.**  

In a world where corpos own your data, AI runs the grid, and privacy is a relic of the past, **DegenAI** is the glitch in the system. We build tools for the rebels, the hackers, and the ghosts who refuse to be tracked. Our tech keeps you off the radar, automates the grind, and gives you back control—one *encrypted byte* at a time.  

*Privacy isn’t dead. It’s just gone dark.*

## What We Do
At DegenAI, we craft **privacy tools** and **AI agents** to empower humanity against centralized control. Our mission is to protect your data, automate your workflows, and free up your time—all while keeping you invisible to the powers that be. We’re also building the **DegenAI DAO**, a decentralized movement where you help shape the future.

- **Privacy Tools**: Lock down your communications and erase your digital tracks with cutting-edge encryption and stealth tech.  
- **AI Agents**: Deploy custom AI to automate your job—handle tasks, streamline workflows, and stay private while doing it.  
- **Decentralized Governance**: Join the DAO, vote on what’s next, and earn rewards for being part of the resistance.

## Features
- **Unbreakable Encryption**: Your data, your rules. State-of-the-art cryptography keeps it locked down.  
- **Custom AI Agents**: Our third product—AI that adapts to you, automating your work without snitching to the grid.  
- **Stealth Mode**: Stay unseen with tools that dodge detection and scrub your presence.  
- **DAO-Powered**: Govern the project with us. Your voice matters in the underground.
